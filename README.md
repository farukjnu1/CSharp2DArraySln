🧮 Console App for Two-Dimensional Array Test

A simple C# Console Application demonstrating the use of two-dimensional arrays (2D arrays) for data storage, manipulation, and traversal.
This project is a great way to understand matrix-like structures, nested loops, and array indexing in C#.

-----------------------------

📋 Overview

This application showcases how to:

Declare and initialize 2D arrays

Populate data dynamically from user input or predefined values

Traverse arrays using nested loops

Perform operations such as sum, average, or transpose

Display data in a structured table format

It’s an excellent educational example for beginners learning about multi-dimensional data structures in C#.

------------------------------------

🚀 Features

🔢 Create and manage two-dimensional arrays

🧮 Calculate row-wise, column-wise, and total sums

🔁 Traverse and display array data neatly

⌨️ Input data interactively or use auto-generated test data

🧠 Understand array memory layout and indexing

----------------------------------
